			<article class="content_1">My name is Alexandr, 17 years old. I live at Wroclaw and study IT at University of Business in Wroclaw.
										I want to study and work as a web developer, and I think I manage.</article>
			<article class="content_2"></article>
			<article class="content_3">From 2008 to 2017 I went to school, I did not gain any useful skills, and believing that college will give me the necessary knowledge, 
													I graduated 2 years and realized that this is not the place that will give the necessary knowledge for my specialty and I began to look at options for self-development and change of place of study. 
													After a while I decided to move to Wroclaw, Poland to study at a university.
													At the moment I am successfully studying at the Polish University and independently study the technologies for creating web pages.
													<br>
													<br>
													<br>
													In 2016, I became acquainted with C++ programming language, and from 2018, as a compulsory programming language in my college, was C. At this time, I studied the type of HTML data. After entering university and up to this point I changed 2 programming languages. From C++ I switched to Ruby, I wanted to learn On Rails, but later switched to Python and its FrameWork Django. I am currently building web pages as Full Stack Developer using JS with jQuery and Python with Django.
